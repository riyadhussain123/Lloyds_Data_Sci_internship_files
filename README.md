# Lloyds Banking Group Data Science Job Simulation - October 2024

## Project Overview

This repository contains the work completed for the job simulation involving customer churn prediction for the Data Science & Analytics team at Lloyds Banking Group. The objective of the project was to develop a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning, enabling the business to implement effective retention strategies.

## Key Highlights

- Developed and implemented a predictive model using **Random Forest** and other machine learning algorithms, achieving an **F1 score of 0.862**.
- Conducted advanced data preprocessing, including:
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Feature scaling
- Utilized Python libraries such as **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **matplotlib** for data manipulation, model building, and visualization.
- Performed comprehensive model evaluation and tuning by:
  - Optimizing hyperparameters with **GridSearchCV**
  - Analyzing feature importance to derive actionable business insights.
